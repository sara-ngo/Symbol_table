# Symbol_table

##### ArrayST.java
Develop a symbol-table implementation ArrayST that
uses an (unordered) array as the underlying data structure to implement the basic symbol-table
API 

##### FrequencyCounter.java
Modify FrequencyCounter from the text to use ArrayST from
above and also to print all of the values having the highest frequency of occurrence, instead of
just one.

##### AveGPA.java
Write an ArrayST client called AvgGPA that creates a symbol table
mapping letter grades to numerical scores, as in the table below, then reads from standard input a
list of letter grades and computes and prints the average GPA 

##### Spell.java
Write a SeparateChainingHastST client called Spell that takes a
command-line argument specifying the name of the le containing common misspellings (a lineoriented le with each comma-separated line containing a misspelled word and the correct
spelling), then reads text from standard input and prints out the misspelled words in the text
along with the line numbers where they occurred and their correct spellings.

##### TreeTraversal.java
Implement the methods preOrder(), inOrder(), postOrder(), and
levelOrder() in TreeTraversal that return the an iterable object containing nodes of a binary tree
traversed in pre-, in-, post-, and level-order, respectively
